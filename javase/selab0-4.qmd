ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#SE00-4: Abstract/Interface Human**

1. Implement this UML and its classes.

2. Create a @Test and a method for each class:
    - ``Person``
    - ``Animal``
    - ``Teacher``
    - ``Student``
    - ``Dog``
    - ``Cat``

## Basic UML

The interfaces ``HumanAction`` and ``Action`` define a **set of methods or properties that classes must implement.**

The class ``Person`` implements both interfaces and provides implementation for the methods defined in both ``HumanAction`` and ``Action``.

``Animal`` class implements ``Action`` interface and provides its own implementation for the methods defined in the interface.

::: {.column-margin}
Here is an example of a UML diagram that shows the relationship between the interfaces ``HumanAction`` and ``Action`` and the classes ``Person``, ``Teacher``, ``Student``, ``Animal``, ``Dog`` and ``Cat``.
:::

::: {.column-margin}
This **UML diagram illustrates that the classes Person, Teacher, Student, Animals, Dog, Cat all implement the methods defined** in ``HumanAction`` and ``Action``
:::

::: {.column-margin}
It also show the **Inheritance** relationship between classes and implementation relationship between classes and ``interfaces``.
:::


``Teacher`` and ``Student`` classes **inherit** from ``Person`` class and add their own specific behavior/ methods.

``Dog`` and ``Cat`` classes **inherit** from ``Animal`` class and add their own specific behavior/ methods.
